<h1>The Best Movies According to Jim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>We Were Soldiers</h3>
<p>Great war movie. This is where courage and reality are blended to perfection.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Beautifully filmed and contains so many analogies describing the world we
    live in today can be drawn from it.</p>
<h3>Master and Commander</h3>
<p>A story desribing without exageration or excessive dramatics the comradarie and fellowship men can have for each other when facing a common goal and purpose.</p>
